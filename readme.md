ScalaMineSweeper
================

A basic implementation of the Mine Sweeper game in Scala. This is just a toy project I used to
get to grips with the language (it is getting kind of repetitive, though, with versions in
[Rust](https://github.com/aochagavia/RusticMineSweeper),
[Java 8](https://github.com/aochagavia/JavaMineSweeper) and
[C++ 11](https://github.com/aochagavia/CppMineSweeper)).

The project uses SBT, so you can run it using as shown below.

```
sbt run
```
